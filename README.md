# Banana Split

Banana Split is an application built in Angular, Bootstrap, and Electron that can be used to split video files based on ffmpeg's black frame detection feature.

## Installation

To install Banana Split, simply extract the zip file to a location of your choosing. Those familiar with Node can clone the repo and run `npm install`.

## Known Limitations

 - AVI doesn't play well with ffmpeg's video splitting, thus the video is automatically encoded to h.264 using libx264
 - Splitting AVI's may cause a weird starting time for audio/video. This is a limitation of AVI in general.
 - No errors are thrown for permission issues. Make sure you can write to the same folder as the source video.

### Version

2.0.0

### Tech

Banana Split uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) - A complete, cross-platform solution to record, convert and stream audio and video.
* [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) - Because hybrid apps rock
